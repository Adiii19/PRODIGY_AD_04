  Getxcontroller :

  Here we have used the List.generate function which takes in the no of tiles to be generated 
  as we are dealing with a 3x3 grid ,hence 9 tiles. We'll initialize them with blank strings. which will be observalble
  We'll now have a function to update the tile. This function will take an index and a string.
  and then the corresponding tile of the index will be updated with the value.
  then finally a getter function which will fetch the string present in the corresponding index's tile.

  We also have a variable isX to change the user after every input.

  Usage in the mainscreen to render the x and o:
  Ontap:
  It will first check if there is an empty string in the grid tile by using 
  the gettile getter with an index.If yyes then we'll call the updatetile function and pass the index and render the text conditionally.
  If it's X's turn then it will render X else O. After this we'll change the user by inverting the isX value.

  Text: Here we'l simply call the getter
